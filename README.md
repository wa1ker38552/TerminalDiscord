# Terminal Discord
Discord but in terminal.

Works by adding a scanner bot that scans text in Discord and then prints them out to terminal using threading. 
Sends messages to Discord from terminal using webhooks.

Preferred hositng using Replit since the project uses Replit db to save stored chats.
The chat updates every 1 second and contains 3 threads. One for updating Discord messages, one for listening for messages from the user, and one for
checking messages on Discord.
